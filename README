Lattice Boltzmann Benchmark Kernels
===================================

The lattice Boltzmann (LBM) benchmark kernels are a collection of LBM kernel
implementations.

AS SUCH THE LBM BENCHMARK KERNELS ARE NO FULLY EQUIPPED CFD SOLVER AND SOLELY
SERVE THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS AND/OR
EXPERIMENTS.

The benchmark suite was created by the HPC group of Erlangen Regional Computing
Center (RRZE/HPC) [1] and the Chair for System Simulation of FAU (LSS) [2].

See doc/main.rst or doc/main.html subdirectories for rudimentary
documentation.
